  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am a seasoned systems engineer and program manager with over a decade of
    experience leading groundbreaking projects in the medical device industry.
    My passion for advancing healthcare technology has driven me to contribute
    to numerous successful products and innovations, all while managing
    cross-functional teams.

    <h2>My Journey in Medical Devices</h2>
    <p>
      After earning degrees in Biomedical Engineering, I began my career at
      <strong>Mako Surgical</strong>, where I helped design groundbreaking
      robotic systems for orthopedic surgery. This role allowed me to combine my
      engineering expertise with my passion for innovation, resulting in systems
      now used in thousands of surgeries worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      I continued to grow my career earning my degrees in Industrial & Systems
      Engineering and an MBA while at <strong>Auris Robotics</strong>, where I
      managed the capital hardware development of a revolutionary Bronchoscopic
      robotic system and later an Endourology platform. After Auris was acquired
      by <strong>Johnson & Johnson</strong>, I further honed my skills in
      managing FDA submissions, leading successful 510(k) clearances, and
      optimizing development workflows for compliance with stringent industry
      standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I work at <strong>Dexcom</strong>, leading the integration of
      hardware and software systems for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
      technologies. My focus is on enabling partners to leverage Dexcomâ€™s CGM
      technology, integrating it into various healthcare systems to improve the
      lives of millions of patients globally.
